# Mukul_Hase_Resume
This repository is the Tex source for my resume, this gets synced with Overleaf and Github action creates the resume pdf output and updates the gh-branch branch which is exposed by github pages as a direct http url which I use in multiple locations including my website [mukulhase.com](mukulhase.com)
